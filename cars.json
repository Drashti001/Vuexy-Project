And for obvious reasons, you're buying a Bugatti because of its unprecedented performance. With each of its new supercar boasting quicker speeds with more horsepower, it's hard to see who is capable of catching up.Bugatti claims the Divo will accelerate to 62 mph in just 2.4 seconds and that it can hang on through a corner with an astonishing 1.6 g's of grip. Although we doubt we'll have the privilege to pilot a Divo, we have driven the Chiron and can only assume its diabolical alter ego—which weighs a claimed 77 pounds less and takes greater pains to manage the airflow around it—outshines it on the track."
